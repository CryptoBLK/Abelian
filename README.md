## Introduction

Led by Dr. Duncan Wong, the co-inventor of Monero’s Linkable Ring Signature, Abelian is an Accountable Privacy initiative for the cryptocurrency industry. It is a collaborative effort between research institutes of Nanyang Technological University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and University of Wollongong. The development is handled by Hong Kong based blockchain development firm CryptoBLK.

**Privacy:** “What I buy in a supermarket may not be a secret, but do I necessarily want everyone to know? Probably not”  
Somehow privacy in the cryptocurrency space carries negative connotation. But privacy on our transaction record is indeed a very basic need for the technology to gain wide spread adoptions.  
In ABE, proven technologies including linkable ring signature and cryptographic commitment schemes are incorporated into the design to offer users uncompromising privacy.

**Accountability:** “Today’s financial regulatory framework is built on years of experience. We need to adopt an openminded yet carefully balanced approach…”  
Enabling and abiding by regulations, such as AML and taxation policies, in the design solves a lot of concerns from enterprises. They could in turn promote the technology to more users.  
We achieve this by introducing a cryptographic primitive called verifiable encryption into ABE.

**Quantum-safe:** “Elliptic Curve Cryptography was invented in 1985. NSA endorsed it in 2005, and later on warned against it in 2015…”  
Bitcoin, invented in 2008, is built on ECC. But if our target is to build something that enables widespread adoptions in a long term, it may not be wise to ignore the technological advancement trajectory over the past years.  
The privacy and accountability features of ABE are built on Lattice-based cryptography, which enables post-quantum security.

## About this project

This is the core implementation of Abelian. It is open source and completely free to use without restrictions, except for those specified in the license agreement below. There are no restrictions on anyone creating an alternative implementation of Abelian that uses the protocol and network in a compatible manner.

As with many development projects, the repository on Github is considered to be the "staging" area for the latest changes. Before changes are merged into that branch on the main repository, they are tested by individual developers in their own branches, submitted as a pull request, and then subsequently tested by contributors who focus on testing and code reviews. That having been said, the repository should be carefully considered before using it in a production environment, unless there is a patch in the repository for a particular show-stopping issue you are experiencing. It is generally a better idea to use a tagged release for stability.

**Anyone is welcome to contribute to Abelian's codebase!** If you have a fix or code change, feel free to submit it as a pull request directly to the "master" branch. In cases where the change is relatively small or does not affect other parts of the codebase it may be merged in immediately by any one of the collaborators. On the other hand, if the change is particularly large or complex, it is expected that it will be discussed at length either well in advance of the pull request being submitted, or even directly on the pull request.

## Compiling Abelian from source

### Dependencies

The following table summarizes the tools and libraries required to build. A
few of the libraries are also included in this repository (marked as
"Vendored"). By default, the build uses the library installed on the system,
and ignores the vendored sources. However, if no library is found installed on
the system, then the vendored source will be built and used. The vendored
sources are also used for statically-linked builds because distribution
packages often include only shared library binaries (`.so`) but not static
library archives (`.a`).

[^] On Debian/Ubuntu `libgtest-dev` only includes sources and headers. You must
build the library binary manually. This can be done with the following command ```sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev && cd /usr/src/gtest && sudo cmake . && sudo make && sudo mv libg* /usr/lib/ ```

Debian / Ubuntu one liner for all dependencies  
``` sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libzmq3-dev libunbound-dev libsodium-dev libunwind8-dev liblzma-dev libreadline6-dev libldns-dev libexpat1-dev doxygen graphviz libpgm-dev```

### Cloning the repository

Clone recursively to pull-in needed submodule(s):

`$ git clone --recursive https://gitlab.com/abeliancoin/abelian.git`

If you already have a repo cloned, initialize and update:

`$ cd abelian && git submodule init && git submodule update`

### Build instructions

Abelian uses the CMake build system and a top-level [Makefile](Makefile) that
invokes cmake commands as needed.

#### On Linux and OS X

* Install the dependencies
* Change to the root of the source code directory, change to the most recent release branch, and build:

        cd abelian
        git checkout v0.14.0.1
        make

    *Optional*: If your machine has several cores and enough memory, enable
    parallel build by running `make -j<number of threads>` instead of `make`. For
    this to be worthwhile, the machine should have one core and about 2GB of RAM
    available per thread.

    *Note*: If cmake can not find zmq.hpp file on OS X, installing `zmq.hpp` from
    https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq to `/usr/local/include` should fix that error.
    
    *Note*: The instructions above will compile the most stable release of the
    Abelian software. If you would like to use and test the most recent software,
    use ```git checkout master```. The master branch may contain updates that are
    both unstable and incompatible with release software, though testing is always 
    encouraged. 

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/bin`

* Add `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/abelian/build/release/bin"` to `.profile`

* Run Abelian with `abeliand --detach`

* **Optional**: build and run the test suite to verify the binaries:

        make release-test

    *NOTE*: `core_tests` test may take a few hours to complete.

* **Optional**: to build binaries suitable for debugging:

         make debug

* **Optional**: to build statically-linked binaries:

         make release-static

Dependencies need to be built with -fPIC. Static libraries usually aren't, so you may have to build them yourself with -fPIC. Refer to their documentation for how to build them.

* **Optional**: build documentation in `doc/html` (omit `HAVE_DOT=YES` if `graphviz` is not installed):

        HAVE_DOT=YES doxygen Doxyfile

#### On the Raspberry Pi

Tested on a Raspberry Pi Zero with a clean install of minimal Raspbian Stretch (2017-09-07 or later) from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/. If you are using Raspian Jessie, [please see note in the following section](#note-for-raspbian-jessie-users). 

* `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` to install all of the latest software

* Install the dependencies for Abelian from the 'Debian' column in the table above.

* Increase the system swap size:
```	
	sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop  
	sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile  
	CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024  
	sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile start  
```
* Clone abelian and checkout most recent release version:
```
        git clone https://gitlab.com/abeliancoin/abelian.git
	cd abelian
	git checkout tags/v0.14.0.1
```
* Build:
```
        make release
```
* Wait 4-6 hours

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/bin`

* Add `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/abelian/build/release/bin"` to `.profile`

* Run Abelian with `abeliand --detach`

* You may wish to reduce the size of the swap file after the build has finished, and delete the boost directory from your home directory

#### *Note for Raspbian Jessie users:*

If you are using the older Raspbian Jessie image, compiling Abelian is a bit more complicated. The version of Boost available in the Debian Jessie repositories is too old to use with Abelian, and thus you must compile a newer version yourself. The following explains the extra steps, and has been tested on a Raspberry Pi 2 with a clean install of minimal Raspbian Jessie.

* As before, `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` to install all of the latest software, and increase the system swap size

```	
	sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop  
	sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile  
	CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024  
	sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile start  
```

* Then, install the dependencies for Abelian except `libunwind` and `libboost-all-dev`

* Install the latest version of boost (this may first require invoking `apt-get remove --purge libboost*` to remove a previous version if you're not using a clean install):
```
	cd  
	wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.64.0/boost_1_64_0.tar.bz2  
	tar xvfo boost_1_64_0.tar.bz2  
	cd boost_1_64_0  
	./bootstrap.sh  
	sudo ./b2  
```
* Wait ~8 hours
```
	sudo ./bjam cxxflags=-fPIC cflags=-fPIC -a install
```
* Wait ~4 hours

* From here, follow the [general Raspberry Pi instructions](#on-the-raspberry-pi) from the "Clone abelian and checkout most recent release version" step.

#### On Windows:

Binaries for Windows are built on Windows using the MinGW toolchain within
[MSYS2 environment](https://www.msys2.org). The MSYS2 environment emulates a
POSIX system. The toolchain runs within the environment and *cross-compiles*
binaries that can run outside of the environment as a regular Windows
application.

**Preparing the build environment**

* Download and install the [MSYS2 installer](https://www.msys2.org), either the 64-bit or the 32-bit package, depending on your system.
* Open the MSYS shell via the `MSYS2 Shell` shortcut
* Update packages using pacman:  

        pacman -Syuu  

* Exit the MSYS shell using Alt+F4  
* Edit the properties for the `MSYS2 Shell` shortcut changing "msys2_shell.bat" to "msys2_shell.cmd -mingw64" for 64-bit builds or "msys2_shell.cmd -mingw32" for 32-bit builds
* Restart MSYS shell via modified shortcut and update packages again using pacman:  

        pacman -Syuu  


* Install dependencies:

    To build for 64-bit Windows:

        pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain make mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-boost mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl mingw-w64-x86_64-zeromq mingw-w64-x86_64-libsodium mingw-w64-x86_64-hidapi

    To build for 32-bit Windows:
 
        pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain make mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-i686-boost mingw-w64-i686-openssl mingw-w64-i686-zeromq mingw-w64-i686-libsodium mingw-w64-i686-hidapi

* Open the MingW shell via `MinGW-w64-Win64 Shell` shortcut on 64-bit Windows
  or `MinGW-w64-Win64 Shell` shortcut on 32-bit Windows. Note that if you are
  running 64-bit Windows, you will have both 64-bit and 32-bit MinGW shells.

**Cloning**

* To git clone, run:

        git clone --recursive https://gitlab.com/abeliancoin/abelian.git

**Building**

* Change to the cloned directory, run:
	
        cd abelian

* If you are on a 64-bit system, run:

        make release-static-win64

* If you are on a 32-bit system, run:

        make release-static-win32

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/bin`

* **Optional**: to build Windows binaries suitable for debugging on a 64-bit system, run:

        make debug-static-win64
	
* **Optional**: to build Windows binaries suitable for debugging on a 32-bit system, run:

        make debug-static-win32

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/debug/bin`

### On FreeBSD:

The project can be built from scratch by following instructions for Linux above. If you are running abelian in a jail you need to add the flag: `allow.sysvipc=1` to your jail configuration, otherwise lmdb will throw the error message: `Failed to open lmdb environment: Function not implemented`.

We expect to add Abelian into the ports tree in the near future, which will aid in managing installations using ports or packages.

### On OpenBSD:

#### OpenBSD < 6.2

This has been tested on OpenBSD 5.8.

You will need to add a few packages to your system. `pkg_add db cmake gcc gcc-libs g++ gtest`.

The doxygen and graphviz packages are optional and require the xbase set.

The Boost package has a bug that will prevent librpc.a from building correctly. In order to fix this, you will have to Build boost yourself from scratch. Follow the directions here (under "Building Boost"):
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-openbsd.md

You will have to add the serialization, date_time, and regex modules to Boost when building as they are needed by Abelian.

To build: `env CC=egcc CXX=eg++ CPP=ecpp DEVELOPER_LOCAL_TOOLS=1 BOOST_ROOT=/path/to/the/boost/you/built make release-static-64`

#### OpenBSD >= 6.2

You will need to add a few packages to your system. `pkg_add cmake zeromq libiconv`.

The doxygen and graphviz packages are optional and require the xbase set.


Build the Boost library using clang. This guide is derived from: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-openbsd.md

We assume you are compiling with a non-root user and you have `doas` enabled.

Note: do not use the boost package provided by OpenBSD, as we are installing boost to `/usr/local`.

Build cppzmq

Build the cppzmq bindings.

We assume you are compiling with a non-root user and you have `doas` enabled.

```
# Create cppzmq building directory

tar xfz cppzmq-4.2.3.tar.gz

# Start building cppzmq
cd cppzmq-4.2.3
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
doas make install
```

Build abelian: `env DEVELOPER_LOCAL_TOOLS=1 BOOST_ROOT=/usr/local make release-static`

### On Solaris:

The default Solaris linker can't be used, you have to install GNU ld, then run cmake manually with the path to your copy of GNU ld:

        mkdir -p build/release
        cd build/release
        cmake -DCMAKE_LINKER=/path/to/ld -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..
        cd ../..

Then you can run make as usual.

### On Linux for Android (using docker):

        # Build image (for ARM 32-bit)
        docker build -f utils/build_scripts/android32.Dockerfile -t abelian-android .
        # Build image (for ARM 64-bit)
        docker build -f utils/build_scripts/android64.Dockerfile -t abelian-android .
        # Create container
        docker create -it --name abelian-android abelian-android bash
        # Get binaries
        docker cp abelian-android:/src/build/release/bin .

### Building portable statically linked binaries (Cross Compiling)

By default, in either dynamically or statically linked builds, binaries target the specific host processor on which the build happens and are not portable to other processors. Portable binaries can be built using the following targets:

* ```make release-static-linux-x86_64``` builds binaries on Linux on x86_64 portable across POSIX systems on x86_64 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-i686``` builds binaries on Linux on x86_64 or i686 portable across POSIX systems on i686 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv8``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv8 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv7``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv7 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv6``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv6 processors
* ```make release-static-win64``` builds binaries on 64-bit Windows portable across 64-bit Windows systems
* ```make release-static-win32``` builds binaries on 64-bit or 32-bit Windows portable across 32-bit Windows systems

## Running abeliand

The build places the binary in `bin/` sub-directory within the build directory
from which cmake was invoked (repository root by default). To run in
foreground:

    ./bin/abeliand

To list all available options, run `./bin/abeliand --help`.  Options can be
specified either on the command line or in a configuration file passed by the
`--config-file` argument.  To specify an option in the configuration file, add
a line with the syntax `argumentname=value`, where `argumentname` is the name
of the argument without the leading dashes, for example `log-level=1`.

To run in background:

    ./bin/abeliand --log-file abeliand.log --detach

To run as a systemd service, copy
[abeliand.service](utils/systemd/abeliand.service) to `/etc/systemd/system/` and
[abeliand.conf](utils/conf/abeliand.conf) to `/etc/`. The [example
service](utils/systemd/abeliand.service) assumes that the user `abelian` exists
and its home is the data directory specified in the [example
config](utils/conf/abeliand.conf).

If you're on Mac, you may need to add the `--max-concurrency 1` option to
abelian-wallet-cli, and possibly abeliand, if you get crashes refreshing.

## Debugging

This section contains general instructions for debugging failed installs or problems encountered with Abelian. First ensure you are running the latest version built from the Github repo.

### Obtaining stack traces and core dumps on Unix systems

We generally use the tool `gdb` (GNU debugger) to provide stack trace functionality, and `ulimit` to provide core dumps in builds which crash or segfault.

* To use gdb in order to obtain a stack trace for a build that has stalled:

Run the build.

Once it stalls, enter the following command:

```
gdb /path/to/abeliand `pidof abeliand` 
```

Type `thread apply all bt` within gdb in order to obtain the stack trace

* If however the core dumps or segfaults:

Enter `ulimit -c unlimited` on the command line to enable unlimited filesizes for core dumps

Enter `echo core | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` to stop cores from being hijacked by other tools

Run the build.

When it terminates with an output along the lines of "Segmentation fault (core dumped)", there should be a core dump file in the same directory as abeliand. It may be named just `core`, or `core.xxxx` with numbers appended.

You can now analyse this core dump with `gdb` as follows:

`gdb /path/to/abeliand /path/to/dumpfile`

Print the stack trace with `bt`

* To run abelian within gdb:

Type `gdb /path/to/abeliand`

Pass command-line options with `--args` followed by the relevant arguments

Type `run` to run abeliand

### Analysing memory corruption

There are two tools available:

* ASAN

Configure Abelian with the -D SANITIZE=ON cmake flag, eg:

    cd build/debug && cmake -D SANITIZE=ON -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../..

You can then run the abelian tools normally. Performance will typically halve.

* valgrind

Install valgrind and run as `valgrind /path/to/abeliand`. It will be very slow.

### LMDB

Instructions for debugging suspected blockchain corruption as per @HYC

There is an `mdb_stat` command in the LMDB source that can print statistics about the database but it's not routinely built. This can be built with the following command:

`cd ~/abelian/external/db_drivers/liblmdb && make`

The output of `mdb_stat -ea <path to blockchain dir>` will indicate inconsistencies in the blocks, block_heights and block_info table.

The output of `mdb_dump -s blocks <path to blockchain dir>` and `mdb_dump -s block_info <path to blockchain dir>` is useful for indicating whether blocks and block_info contain the same keys.

These records are dumped as hex data, where the first line is the key and the second line is the data.
